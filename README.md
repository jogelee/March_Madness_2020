# March_Madness_2020

This was *intended* to compete in the annual March Madness competition that Kaggle hosts every year. It runs an XGBoost model and outputs win probabilities for every possible matchup given the starting state of the tournament bracket. The training data consists of NCAA regular season and tournament data from 2003 forward.
